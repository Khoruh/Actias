# Actias
Welcome to the github repository for Actias.
I have made this repo public for the intended purposes of ***learning and referencing*** as finding full discord bots to learn from can be quite difficult.  

***Do NOT download or clone this repo for the purpose of your own use.***  
However as this is now more or less open source, you can theoretically freely make pull requests to request/make additions to Actias.  

***Note: Due to Actias' config files (configFiles/), guild specific configs (guildConfig/), and node_modules/, not being uploaded to the repo, this may be quite restrictive to work around, and the creation of certain commands will just not be possible.***
